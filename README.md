# Agile Planning Lab

# Objective
Create a kanban board and sample issues to demonstrate the process of agile planning and the scrum process. 

# Tools Used
- Zenhub
- Github
- Kanban board

# Steps
1. First I created my Kanban board in github and then proceeded to link it to my Zenhub account so the board would be accessible to both and auto update.

2. Then I returned to Github and proceeded to the issues tab where I created a new user story using the template that I created.

3. I then linked the issue to my agile lab planning project and assigned it to the new issues pipeline of my Kanban board.

4. I then repeated this process four more times to create a total of five issues to be placed into my Kanban board.

5. Next I prioritized the issues in my Kanban board both on Github and Zenhub to set myself up for the process of backlog refinement.

6. Then I edited the current product backlog issues to add details and assumptions onto the issues to make them sprint ready.

7. I then proceeded to do the same for the other three items in the product backlog. Next I needed to create a new label for my Kanban board called technical debt to label items that provide no visible customer value but must be completed in order to continue development.

8. Next I returned to the Kanban board and took each individual issue in the backlog and provided it with an appropriate label to further prepare them for the sprint.

9. I then went over to Zenhub to confirm that my changes made in Github had updated.

10. My next step then was to setup sprints, assign estimates to the sprints, assign a sprint to the issues, and then build a sprint backlog. To create my sprint I first needed to add the new field to my Kanban board.

11. Then I opened the first issue in the product backlog and added an estimate to it and assigned it to the first sprint.

12. I then iterated through the same process for the remaninder of the product backlog and ended up with the following result.

13. I then went over to Zenhub to update my Kanban board there with the same estimates and move the issues into the sprint backlog pipeline.

14. My next move was then to take the first task in the sprint backlog assign it to myself and move it to the in process pipeline to allow the rest of the team to know I was working on this issue.

15. Once the code is updated for the issue this is where I would have input a pull request to merge my code with the main branch and have it reviewed by the team. While the review process is underway I would assign myself another issue I had the skills to handle and begin work on that.

16. Fianlly once the review is complete on the issue submitted the last step was to move the issue to the done pipeline to update the team, srum master, and product owner that this task is complete.
